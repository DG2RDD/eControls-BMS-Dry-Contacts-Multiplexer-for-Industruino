# eControls-BMS-Dry-Contacts-Multiplexer-for-Industruino

The regular Industruino comes with 8 digital I/O and 4 Analog Inputs.

There are times when you need more digital and less Analog inputs. This repository adresses this problem by decribing a way to multiplex 5 dry contacts into one of your analog inputs.

The repo includes two versions (one French and one English)
- T_DMULTV-Industruino-FSA is the French version
- T_DMULTV-Industruino-FSA is the English version

Each version includes two files
- The .ods file is a simulator that explains how the multuplexer works, and what hardware you will have to create yourself
- the .ino file is the corresponding program, designed to work standalone
